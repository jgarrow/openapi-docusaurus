# ETH Step-by-step

## 1. Create a user

<CreateUser />

## 2. Search for an Institution

To create a member, you need to know what financial institution the member should be connected to and what type of credentials the institution expects to get.

First, search for an institution using query parameters on the list institutions endpoint, GET `/institutions?name={string}&supports_transaction_history=true`.

The example searches for MX Bank, which is [MX's institution for testing and development](xxx). It also limits results to institutions that support ETH.

The response returns a paginated list of institutions that match the string you send in the `name` query parameter. Make a note of the `code` you find in the example response; you'll need this for the next step.

<SearchInstitutionsResponse />

## 3. Get the Institution's Required Credentials

<RequiredCredentials />

## 4. Create a Member

For this step, you need to have already gathered from the end user the values needed for each credential. The following example uses the MX Bank institution and therefore requires a username and a password; it sets the username to `mxuser` and the password to `password` which are the credentials for the test user for MX Bank.

Make a POST request to the `/users/{user_guid}/members` endpoint. The response includes the newly created `member`.
  * Put the `user_guid` in the path.
  * In the body, include the credential GUIDs and their values in the `credentials` array.
  * In the body, set the `skip_aggregation` parameter to `true`.
    * A standard aggregation is kicked off automatically whenever a member is created unless you explicitly prevent it using `skip_aggregation`. Since you're about to perform an ETH job, there's no need a for a standard agg.
  * In the body, set the `id` and `metadata` fields as you see fit. This is not required, but is strongly encouraged.
  * Optionally, you can disable background aggregation with the `background_aggregation_is_disabled` parameter. It defaults to `false`. In other words, background aggregation is enabled by default.

<Admonition type="warning">
Do not add multiple members that connect to the same `institution` using the same `credentials` on the same `user`. This will result in a `409 Conflict` error.
</Admonition>

<CreateMember />
<CreateMemberResponse />

## 5. Start an ETH job

Now we can actually begin the process of gathering up to 24 months of transaction data.

Make a POST request to the `/users/{user_guid}/members/{member_guid}/extend_history` endpoint. This request only starts the ETH process; actually reading the aggregated data comes later. The response will be a `member` object with information about the state of the ETH process that just started.

<ExtendHistory />
<ExtendHistoryResponse />

## 6. Check the Connection Status

<CheckStatus job_type="ETH" />

## 7. Deal with Multifactor Authentication

Aggregation-type jobs such as ETH may trigger multifactor authentication (MFA) from the institution associated with the member. This is indicated by `connection_status: CHALLENGED`.

Please see the detailed section on [answering MFA challenges](/products/balance_checks/dealing_with_mfa) for more information. For this part of the guide, we'll assume there was no MFA and move on to the next step.
