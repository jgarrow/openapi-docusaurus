# Intro to Extended Transaction History

## What is Extended Transaction History

Standard aggregation allows you to gather account and transaction data for up to 90 days. The Platform API's Extended Transaction History (ETH) extends this time period to up to 24 months, depending on the financial institution.

This guide will take you through the ETH process using API endpoints. After reading this guide, you’ll be able to:

* Create a user.
* Search for an institution.
* Create a member.
* Gather an extended transaction history.
* Read the gathered account and transaction data.

## API Workflow

The workflow for performing a balance check is as follows:

1. Create a user.
1. Search for an institution.
1. Get the credentials required by the institution.
1. Create a member.
1. Poll the member’s connection status.
1. Answer multifactor authentication, if necessary.
1. Poll the member’s connection status again until it reaches an end state.
    * A successful end state is when the connection_status is CONNECTED and the is_aggregating field changes from true to false.
1. List the member’s account information or read a particular account’s information.
1. List the member’s transaction information or read a particular transaction's information.
