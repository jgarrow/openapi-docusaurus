# Extended Transaction History

> _Get up to 24 months of account and transaction data_

With Extended Transaction History, you can connect to an end user’s financial institution and retrieve up to 24 months data for their accounts and transactions. Standard account aggregation provides only 90 days.

You can use this data for any number of solutions such as personal financial management or risk analysis. Data is available for accounts ranging from checking and savings to mortgages and credit cards — and everything in between. We cleanse this data to make it understandable to end users, and we automatically put it into more than 100 predefined categories. We also add enhanced information such as which merchant was involved in a transaction and whether it represents a direct deposit, bill pay, or subscription.
