# Overview

You can aggregate data using the MXconnect widget. It's important to note that there are many configuration options available, all of which can be viewed in our [API Reference](/platform-api/mx-platform-api).

Get instructions about downloading our demo app to see aggregation with MXconnect in action.

Visit our Connect Widget Generator to easily build JSON code to configure your widget.

To aggregate using MXconnect, follow these instructions:

---

## 1. Create a user

The first step is to create a user. A user represents your end user in the MX Platform. Make a POST request to the [create user endpoint](/platform-api/create-user), as shown below.

```js test.js
const testFn = () => {
  console.log("test");
};
```

We recommend that you include a unique `id` of your choice with the request. You may also include `metadata`, such as the date the `user` was created or the end user's name. Don't include any sensitive information here, such as credentials.

None of these parameters are required, but the `user` object cannot be empty. We recommend that partners always set the `id` parameter when creating a user.

</Admonition>

In the response, the API gives each new `user` an MX-defined guid (or `user_guid` when appearing outside the `user` object). Between your `id` and the `guid`, you can map between your system and ours. You'll need the user `guid` for nearly every request on the MX API, at least when using basic authorization.

```bash
curl -i -X POST 'https://int-api.mx.com/users' \
-u 'client_id:api_key' \
-H 'Accept: application/vnd.mx.api.v1+json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
      "user": {
        "id": "partner-2345",
        "is_disabled": false,
        "email": "totally.fake.email@notreal.com",
        "metadata": "Yada yada yada"
      }
    }'
```

## 2. Request an MXconnect URL

Make a POST request to the `widget_urls` endpoint using the guid.

<Admonition type="info">

Ensure that the mode is set to aggregation.

</Admonition>

```bash title=Endpoint:
POST /users/{user_guid}/widget_urls
```

```bash
curl -i -X POST 'https://int-api.mx.com/users/USR-11141024-90b3-1bce-cac9-c06ced52ab4c/widget_urls' \
-u '{client_id}:{api_key}' \
-H 'Accept: application/vnd.mx.api.v1+json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
      "widget_url": {
        "widget_type": "connect_widget",
        "color_scheme": "dark"
      }
    }'
```

## 3. Embed MXconnect

There are many considerations and possible paths for embedding MXconnect depending on your integration type and use case. So we've got a separate guide on embedding MXconnect which covers all the possibilities. Check out the details there.
