# Intro to Account Owner Identification

## In This Guide

This guide will take you through the Account Owner Identification (AOI) process using API endpoints. After reading this guide, you’ll be able to:

* Create a user.
* Search for an institution.
* Create a member.
* Gather account owner data.
* Deal with multifactor authentication
* Read the gathered owner data.

## API Workflow

The workflow for performing a balance check is as follows:

1. Create a user.
1. Search for an institution.
1. Get the credentials required by the institution.
1. Create a member.
1. Start an AOI job.
1. Poll the member’s connection status.
1. Answer multifactor authentication, if necessary.
1. Poll the member’s connection status again until it reaches an end state.
    * A successful end state is when the `connection_status` is `CONNECTED` and the `is_aggregating` field changes from `true` to `false`.
1. List the member’s owner information or read a particular owner's information.
