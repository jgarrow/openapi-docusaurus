# Account Owner Identification

> Get the name, address, and contact information for the owner of an account

With Account Owner Identification, you can connect to an end user’s financial account to retrieve information such as name and address. You can use this data to verify the information provided by an end user. This can be used for solutions that require fraud and risk reduction, account opening, and digital banking.

The Account Owner Identification product can be used as a standalone product or in combination with other MX products. If you use Account Owner Identification as a stand-alone product, you cannot use our Connect Widget interface for connecting accounts and will be required to complete an API-only integration. We encourage you to use Account Owner Identification in conjunction with Account Aggregation or Instant Account Verification so you can use our powerful Connect Widget.
