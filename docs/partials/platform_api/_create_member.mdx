After you have the `user_guid`, an `institution_code`, and a `guid` for each credential required by the institution, create a new `member`. For this step, you need the values provided by the end user for each necessary credential.

Make a POST request to the `/users/{user_guid}/members` endpoint. The response includes the newly created `member` and a standard aggregation is automatically kicked off. The `connection_status` is `CREATED` and the `is_being_aggregated` field is `true`.

You can include the following parameters in your request.

| Parameter                            | Data type | Description | Required? |
|:-------------------------------------|:----------|:------------|:----------|
| `background_aggregation_is_disabled` | Boolean   | When set to `true`, background aggregation will be disabled for this `member`. | No        |
| `credentials`                        | Array     | The credentials endpoint for the requested `institution` will give you a list of all the `credentials` required to create a `member` for a given `institution`. Each required credential will need to be included within this array. | Yes       |
| `id`                                 | String    | The unique partner-defined identifier for the `member`. | No        |
| `institution_code`                   | String    | The unique code for the `institution` to which the `member` will connect. Defined by MX. | Yes       |
| `metadata`                           | String    | Additional information you can store on this `member`. | No        |

The following example uses MX Bank and therefore requires a username and a password. It sets the username to `mxuser` and the password to `password` which are the credentials for the test user for MX Bank. For real institutions, these values must be the end user's correct login information.

Do not add multiple members that connect to the same <code>institution</code> using the same <code>credentials</code> on the same <code>user</code>. This will result in a <code>409 Conflict</code> error.
