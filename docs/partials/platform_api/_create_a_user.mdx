A user represents your end user in the MX Platform. Make a POST request to the `/users` endpoint, as shown below.

We recommend that you include a unique [`id`](/api#identifiers_and_metadata) of your choice with the request. You may also include `metadata`, such as the date the `user` was created or the end user's name. Don't include any sensitive information here, such as credentials.

<Admonition type="info" >
None of these parameters are required, but the <code>user</code> object cannot be empty. We recommend that partners always set the `id` parameter when creating a user.
</Admonition>

In the response, the API gives each new `user` an MX-defined `guid` (or `user_guid` when appearing outside the `user` object). Between your `id` and the `guid`, you can map between your system and ours. You'll need the user `guid` for nearly every request on the MX API, at least when using basic authorization.
