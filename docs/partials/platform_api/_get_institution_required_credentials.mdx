Each institution requires different types of credentials. Some require an email and a password, some require a username and a password, and some may require other types of credentials.

Make a GET request to the `/institutions/{institution_code}/credentials` endpoint. Include the institution code retrieved from the previous step in the request path.

This endpoint returns the GUID for each required credential, which is used to match the credentials the end user provides to the required credential type when creating a member.
