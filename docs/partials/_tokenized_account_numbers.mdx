OAuth connections for the Chase institution do not return end users' actual account numbers for deposit accounts. Instead, they return a Tokenized Account Number (TAN) and an associated routing number (ABA). The TAN will not have any similarity to the actual account number; the ABA returned will be a valid, but will not be the one associated with the real account number. In other words, the `account_number` field returned from `/users/{user_guid}/members/{member_guid}/account_numbers` will be a TAN for Chase OAuth connections.

The TAN and associated ABA returned through the verification endpoint are valid for money movement on the ACH system, but **only when used together**; for instance, using the TAN with a different ABA also associated with the institution will not work for money movement. Nevertheless, these numbers **will not match** end users' actual account numbers for verification purposes.

Don't display the TAN returned for OAuth connections to end users. They may not recognize it. Instead, display the masked account number returned by the `/users/{user_guid}/accounts/{account_number}` endpoint to the end user, but use the TAN for ACH transfers.

While Chase is currently the only institution on the MX platform which returns TANs, other institutions may do so in the future. So it is best practice to treat **all** account and routing numbers returned for OAuth connections as though they were a TAN.

Non-OAuth connections will return real account and routing numbers.
