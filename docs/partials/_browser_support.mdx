MX supports its web applications (i.e., Pulse, MoneyMap, individual widgets, and mini widgets) on the HTML 5-compliant browsers listed below. As of March 20, 2017, only browsers that support TLSv1.2 will be able to interact with MX products.

### Supported Desktop Browsers

MX tests its web applications on the current and immediately preceding versions of the browsers listed in the table below. MX recommends using your browser’s auto-update feature to stay current on the latest version.

| Browser | PC | Mac |
|---------|----|-----|
| Chrome | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Edge | Yes | N/A |
| Firefox | Yes | Yes |
| Safari | No | Yes |

### Older Desktop Browsers

Older versions of the browsers listed above are not explicitly tested, but MX will attempt to review and address issues as they are reported. If a reasonable accommodation cannot be made, upgrading or switching to a supported browser may be recommended.

However, MX does not support any versions of Internet Explorer and will not address bugs or issues related to it.

### Blocked Desktop Browsers

We want our partners and clients to have the best possible experience while using our products. Therefore, MX may actively block some browsers from displaying our products when the results would provide an extremely poor user experience.

Degrading browser performance by using alternate browser modes (such as Quirks or Compatibility modes) may prevent MX products from functioning properly.

### Supported Mobile Browsers

MX tests its web applications on the current and immediately preceding versions of the iOS and Android operating systems. For each supported OS version, MX tests on both the current and immediately preceding versions of the browsers listed below. MX recommends using your browser’s auto-update feature to stay current on the latest version.

| Browser | iOS | Android |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Chrome | No | Yes |
| Safari | Yes | N/A |
| WKWebView | Yes | N/A |
| Android WebView | N/A | Yes |

MX no longer supports UIWebView. Apple stopped recommending the use of UIWebView beginning with the release of iOS 8 in September 2014. It now [recommends using WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwebview).

### Older Mobile Browsers

Older versions of browsers listed above are not explicitly tested, but MX will attempt to review and address issues as they are reported. If a reasonable accommodation cannot be made, upgrading or switching to a supported browser may be recommended.
