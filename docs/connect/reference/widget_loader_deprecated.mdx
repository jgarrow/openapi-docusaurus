# Connect Widget JavaScript Loader (Deprecated)

<Admonition type="info">
The JavaScript loader is deprecated. The loader below will continue to work, but clients should use the new [web SDK](xxx) instead.
</Admonition>

Once you've generated a URL, you can pass that information on to a JavaScript loader provided by MX. This loader allows you to further configure your Connect widget, including the size as well as all the supported configuration options, inside the `config` object.

It also allows you to listen for event messages that indicate loading or a successful member creation.

<Admonition type="warning">
The event messages handled by `onEvent` below allow partners to take action in their own codebase in response to events triggered within the Connect widget's UI. They are intended specifically to allow a partnerâ€™s code and the widget's UI to work in concert over a single session, not to give canonical information on the state of a `member` or other information available by request to the appropriate endpoint, e.g., **read member connection status**.
