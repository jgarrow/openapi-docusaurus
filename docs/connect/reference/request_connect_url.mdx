# Request a Connect Widget URL

This endpoint allows partners to get a URL by passing the `widget_type` in the request body, as well as configuring it in several different ways. In the case of Connect, that means setting the `widget_type` to `connect_widget`. Partners may also pass an optional `Accept-Language` header. Note that this is a POST request.

Widget URLs are one-time use. You must fetch a new widget URL each time you load the widget.

<Admonition type="notice">
In this request, the Connect Widget must be carefully configured for the specific task it is being used for. Please see the extensive [section on configuration](xxx) for the complete list of parameters and all the details youâ€™ll need to set them correctly.
