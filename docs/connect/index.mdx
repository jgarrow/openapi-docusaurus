# What is the Connect Widget?

The Connect Widget is a ready-made application which automates several processes, including [Account Aggregation](xxx), [Instant Account Verification](xxx), [Specialized Account Aggregation](xxx)and [Account Owner Identification](xxx) (with some caveats). It helps the end user search for their financial institution, collects their credentials, prompts for multifactor authentication, and resolves errors all in a single UI, meaning you won’t have to code any of these things on your own.

The Connect Widget is designed to be embedded into a website or mobile app with [one of our SDKs](xxx).

You’ll be using a Platform API endpoint to load and configure Connect Widget. You’ll use separate API endpoints to actually read the data that has been aggregated by Connect.

Therefore, before you get started, make sure you’ve:

* Signed up for the API through the [client dashboard](xxx).
* Read through the [API requirements](xxx).
